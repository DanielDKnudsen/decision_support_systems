# 6. In this exercise, you will further analyze the Wage data set considered throughout this chapter.

# (a) Perform polynomial regression to predict wage using age.
# Use cross-validation to select the optimal degree d for the polynomial.
# What degree was chosen, and how does this compare to the results of hypothesis testing using ANOVA? Make a plot of
# the resulting polynomial fit to the data.



# (b) Fit a step function to predict wage using age, and perform crossvalidation
# to choose the optimal number of cuts. Make a plot of the fit obtained.
