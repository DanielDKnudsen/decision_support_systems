# In the lab, we applied random forests to the Boston data using mtry=6  and using ntree=25 and ntree=500.
# Create a plot displaying the test error resulting from random forests on this data set for a more comprehensive
# range of values for mtry and ntree.
# You can model your plot after Figure 8.10. Describe the results obtained.
