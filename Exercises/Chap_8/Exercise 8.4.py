# 4. This question relates to the plots in Figure 8.12.
#
# (a) Sketch the tree corresponding to the partition of the predictor
# space illustrated in the left-hand panel of Figure 8.12.
# The numbers inside the boxes indicate the mean of Y within each region.



# (b) Create a diagram similar to the left-hand panel of Figure 8.12,
# using the tree illustrated in the right-hand panel of the same figure.
# You should divide up the predictor space into the correct regions, and indicate the mean for each region.
